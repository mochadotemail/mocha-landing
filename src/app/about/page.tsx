            We are working on building the first inbox that works like an
            extension of your mind - it writes in your voice, organizes itself
            based on your habits, and gives you rule-based control over
            everything.

            The goal is to create a system that reduces friction, respects your
            workflow, and adapts to how you work â€“ not the other way around.
