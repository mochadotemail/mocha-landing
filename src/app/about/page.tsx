            We are working on building the first inbox that works like an
            extension of your mind - it writes in your voice, organizes itself
            based on your habits, and gives you rule-based control over
            everything.
          </p>
          <p className="text-muted-foreground  leading-relaxed mb-8">
            The goal is to create a system that reduces friction, respects your
            workflow, and adapts to how you work â€“ not the other way around.
          </p>
           <p className="text-muted-foreground text-xl leading-relaxed">
          We're a small team of developers and designers building tools
          that make email more personal, programmable, and effortless to work
          with.
